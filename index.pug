          p The Sun (its symbol ☉) is the central star of the Solar System. It is nearly spherical and contains a hot plasma interlaced with a magnetic field. Its diameter is about 1,392,684 km, which is 109 times the diameter of the Earth
          p Chemically speaking, hydrogen makes up three-quarters of the components of the solar mass, and the rest is mostly helium with a ratio of 1.69% (roughly equivalent to 5,628 Earth's mass) of the heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, iron and other elements.
          p The sun's galactic orbit is far from the center of the galaxy at an approximate distance ranging between 24,000-26,000 light-years, the sun completes its galactic orbit or the galactic year as it appears from the North Galactic Pole in about 225-250 million years.

          p It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight

In English, Mars bears the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of iron oxide predominant on the surface of Mars, giving it a distinct reddish appearance among astronomical objects visible to the naked eye.

          p Saturn (its symbol ♄) is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture.
          p Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.

Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
          p Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other gas giants.
